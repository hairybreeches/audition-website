			li made to unrelated, unusual, or seldom-used accounts,
			li made by individuals who typically do not make journal entries,
			li recorded at the end of the period or as post-closing entries that have little or no explanation or description,
			li made either before or during the preparation of the financial statements that do not have account numbers,
			li containing round numbers or consistent ending numbers
