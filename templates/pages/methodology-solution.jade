			h1 How can Audition help?
			p Audition Software has been carefully designed with the methodology requirements of the FRC in mind

			p The Financial Reporting Council’s recent thematic report on fraud risks and laws and regulations made several recommendations as to what contributed good practice in these areas. One of these was the suggestion that auditors should expect to be “Using CAATs [Computer Aided Audit Techniques] on all audits to test journal entries, with exceptions expected to be rare”.
			p We couldn’t agree more. It’s pretty much impossible to manage journal sampling manually or using just a spreadsheet, due to both the number of journals involved, and the trickiness of the question being asked: it’s not easy to write a formula that lists all the journals with an account code shared by fewer than 10 other entries, for example.
			p Audition allows you to connect directly to the client’s accounting system and:
				ul
					li Search for entries posted out of normal working hours
					li View all journals made to account codes with an abnormally small number of entries. 
					li Inspect all entries not made by the individuals who would normally be expected to post journals.
					li Retrieve journals made near to or after the year end. 
					li Find journals containing round numbers or with consistent endings
					li Search for journals containing keywords characteristic of fraud, such as “miscellaneous”.
			p	These tests are tailored to meet the recommendations of characteristics of fraud made in ISA 240, and as such will give you a hand making your audits 100% ISA compliant.
